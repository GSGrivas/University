        <h2 id="technical">Technical FAQs</h2>
                <p>
            <strong>What computer skills are required?</strong><br />
            <em>Some basic skills are required. Use of the computer is an important
            part of the program, but in early grades it is mostly the parent (or
            other responsible adult) who interacts with the computer.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What computer equipment is required to use Etrain?</strong><br />
            <em>You need either a Windows-based or Apple Macintosh computer with an
            Internet connection and free software programs that can be downloaded
            from the Internet. Most courses have audio, so speakers are required.
            You will also need a printer if you want to create hard copies of the
            activity worksheets.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Can I use Etrain on my mobile device or e-reader?</strong><br />
            <em>Yes, most of the material can be accessed through devices such as
            <a href="http://www.apple.com/za/ipad">iPads</a>, iPhones, Kindles, Nooks and the newer Android phones.</em>
